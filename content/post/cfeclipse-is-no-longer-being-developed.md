summary: CFEclipse is not longer being developed
---

For the past three years or more the CFEclipse Project has had no active contributors.   I took over the domain in the hope of re-invigorating it, but it became apparent that I didn't have the skills to keep the plugin updated with both Eclipse Releases and CFML Language Improvements.

I will shortly be archiving all the Github repositories, and have set up this site as a landing page for the cfeclipse.org domain.  The Eclipse update sites have been retained, although I'm not certain if they still work with any current eclipse releases. 

Although I am no longer programming CFML myself, for anyone looking for a CFML Editor, I highly recommend the [Visual Sudio Code CFML Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KamasamaK.vscode-cfml).

Lastly I'd like to shout out to all the [past contributors to CFEclipse](page/contributors), and to [Vivio Technologies](https://viviotech.net/) for donating hosting for many years - including this current site.
